Hi {{ name }},

Great question on pricing - I want to make sure I give you the right context.

Our pricing is typically based on:
• Team size and usage volume
• Which capabilities you need
• Implementation scope

Most teams like {{ company }} see ROI within the first 90 days, primarily through:
• [X]% improvement in rep productivity
• [Y]% increase in pipeline accuracy
• [Z] hours saved per rep per week

Rather than throw numbers at you, it might make more sense to hop on a quick call so I can understand your specific situation and give you a tailored estimate.

Would that be helpful?

Best,
