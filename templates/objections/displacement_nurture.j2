Hi {{ name }},

That makes sense - glad you have something in place.

Out of curiosity, how's it working for you? I ask because we've had a few {{ company }}-sized teams recently switch over, and they mentioned a few gaps in their previous setup around [forecasting accuracy / pipeline visibility / rep productivity].

Not trying to poach you away, but if you ever want to compare notes or see what's changed in the space, happy to share what we're seeing.

Either way, best of luck with everything.

Best,
