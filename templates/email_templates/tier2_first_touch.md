## ANGLE A: The Tech Stack Integration Play

**Best For:** CTOs/CIOs who are evaluating AI but need tactical guidance

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `{{first_name}} - AI for {{company}}'s tech stack`
2. `Noticed {{company}} is using {{tech_stack}}`
3. `AI integration for {{tech_stack}} teams`
4. `Quick idea for {{company}}'s operations`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} is using {{tech_stack}}—we actually have a specific AI integration playbook for that stack.

Most {{title}} roles I talk to are seeing two blockers:
1. The CTO is buried in legacy tech maintenance
2. No dedicated AI strategy lead to drive implementation

We bridge that gap as your Fractional Chief AI Officer—moving from "AI pilot" to production workflows in 90 days.

**What teams like yours are automating:**
- Lead enrichment & qualification (from raw data to booked meetings)
- Document processing & extraction (invoices, contracts, reports)
- Customer support triage (route, respond, escalate)

Would it be helpful if I shared the AI tech stack we're seeing work best for {{industry}}?

Cheers,
**Dani Apgar**

## ANGLE B: The Operations Efficiency Play

**Best For:** COOs, VP Operations, Directors focused on cost reduction

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `{{company}}'s operational efficiency`
2. `{{first_name}} - cutting {{company}}'s overhead`
3. `AI for operations teams at {{company}}`
4. `Quick win for {{company}}'s back-office`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

The teams we work with are seeing 40-60% time savings on operational tasks using AI automation.

**Specifically:**
- One 150-person firm saved 300+ hours in 30 days on administrative work
- A 7-person pilot team saw 27% productivity boost in the first month
- AI now handles the work of 20+ staff in Operations at one of our travel clients

The pattern: start with high-volume, low-complexity tasks (data entry, scheduling, reporting), prove ROI in 30 days, then expand.

We call it the M.A.P. framework: **Measure → Automate → Prove**

Open to a brief sync next Tuesday, or should I just send over a one-pager for now?

## ANGLE C: The Innovation/Transformation Champion Play

**Best For:** Heads of Innovation, Digital Transformation leads, Chief of Staff

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `AI transformation at {{company}}`
2. `{{first_name}} - building the AI Council`
3. `Accelerating {{company}}'s AI roadmap`
4. `Innovation question for {{first_name}}`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

75%+ of AI pilots stall before ROI is proven.

The root cause we see: insufficient governance and process integration. CFOs see spend but not savings. Teams focus on "AI chatbots" instead of operational transformation.

We fix this by building an **AI Council** inside your company—internal champions from every department who drive adoption from within.

**Our 90-day approach:**
1. Day 1: Executive bootcamp (your team leaves AI-ready)
2. Weeks 2-8: We co-pilot with your AI Council, build the workflows
3. Weeks 9-12: Measure ROI, hand off the playbook

If the M.A.P. cycle doesn't deliver tangible savings, you don't pay the next phase.

Mind if I send over a 2-minute video on how we do this?

Cheers,
**Dani Apgar**

It's not a pitch—just a visual breakdown of how we'd automate [specific workflow] for teams like yours.
