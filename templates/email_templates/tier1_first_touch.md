## ANGLE A: Executive Buy-In (The "Fractional CAIO" Gap)

**Best For:** CEOs/Founders stuck in "AI research mode" without implementation

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `AI Roadmap for {{company}}`
2. `Quick question regarding {{company}}'s AI strategy`
3. `Fractional AI leadership for {{company}}`
4. `{{first_name}}, bridging the AI gap at {{company}}`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Seeing a lot of {{industry}} firms stuck in "AI research mode" without moving to implementation.

Usually, it's because the CTO is buried in legacy tech and there's no dedicated AI lead to drive the strategy forward.

We act as your Fractional Chief AI Officer to move {{company}} from curiosity to ROI—typically in 90 days.

**What that looks like:**
- Day 1: One-day M.A.P. Bootcamp (your team leaves with an AI-ready action plan)
- Days 2-90: We embed with your team, build the workflows, and measure results
- Guarantee: Measurable ROI, or you don't pay the next phase

Worth a brief chat on how we're doing this for similar {{industry}} companies?

Best,
**Dani Apgar**  
Chief AI Officer

**ANGLE A ALTERNATIVE (HoS Approved):**

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `From AI Talk to ROI in 90 Days`
2. `Why {{industry}} Firms Are Stuck (And How to Unstick Them)`
3. `Skip the Hype. Start Seeing AI Results.`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Seeing a lot of {{industry}} firms stuck in "AI research mode."

No roadmap. No AI lead. CTO buried in legacy systems.

That's where we come in.

We embed as your Fractional Chief AI Officer—taking {{company}} from curiosity to compounding ROI in just 90 days.

**Here's how the M.A.P.™ Framework works:**
- **Day 1:** One-day Bootcamp → your execs leave with a real AI action plan
- **Days 2–90:** We embed, build high-impact pilots, track KPIs
- **Guarantee:** Measurable ROI—or you don't pay the next phase

We've done this for construction, biotech, PE-backed firms, and more. One client clawed back 1,000+ hours annually in a single pilot.

Worth a quick chat this week to explore how this could work at {{company}}?

Best,
**Dani Apgar**
Chief AI Officer

P.S. No tech skills required. We train your team and document every SOP so wins stick—even after we roll off.

## ANGLE B: YPO / Industry-Specific Angle

**Best For:** Construction, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Professional Services CEOs

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `AI in {{industry}} / {{company}}`
2. `Automating {{company}}'s back-office?`
3. `{{first_name}} - saw your profile in {{network}}`
4. `Quick question for {{industry}} CEOs`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Many {{industry}} CEOs I speak with are frustrated by thin margins and operational inefficiency.

The fix we're seeing work: AI automating the back-office "drudge work"—project estimation, invoicing, scheduling, reporting—so your team can focus on revenue.

**Example:** A 150-person {{industry}} firm saved 300+ hours in 30 days and saw a 27% productivity boost after our 90-day AI pilot.

Are you open to seeing a quick breakdown of the workflow we built for them?

Best,
**Dani Apgar**  
Chief AI Officer

3. `Bridge strategy for {{company}}`

**Email Body:**

**In just 90 days, we:**
- Define your AI roadmap before the hire starts
- Train your current team on AI fundamentals

## ANGLE D: Value-First / Soft CTA

**Best For:** Cold leads where hard CTA might feel too aggressive

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `2-minute AI readiness check for {{company}}`
2. `{{first_name}} - quick resource for {{industry}} leaders`
3. `AI quick wins for {{industry}}`
4. `Thought this might help, {{first_name}}`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I put together a 2-minute "AI Readiness" audit for {{industry}} leaders.

It covers the 3 biggest low-hanging fruit automation wins we're seeing right now—ones that typically save 10-20 hours per week per team member.

Mind if I send the link over?

(No pitch, no 30-minute demo request—just a quick self-assessment.)
