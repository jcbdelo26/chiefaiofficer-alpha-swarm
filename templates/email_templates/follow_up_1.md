Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

I put together a 2-minute "AI Readiness" audit specifically for {{industry}} leaders. 

It covers the 3 biggest low-hanging fruit automation wins we're seeing right now—ones that typically save 10-20 hours per week per team member.

Mind if I send the link over?

(No pitch, no 30-minute demo request—just a quick self-assessment you can complete in under 3 minutes.)

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note from earlier this week about AI-powered operations.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

**One stat:** {{industry}} teams using AI automation are seeing 60% time savings on administrative work. That time goes back to revenue-generating activities.

**One question:** Is your team exploring AI for operations, or is it a "next year" priority?

If yes, let's talk. If not yet, no worries—happy to stay in touch for when the timing's better.
