## ANGLE A: Quick Win (The "One Workflow" Starter)

**When to Use:** Default for SMB, no specific trigger  
**CTA Ladder Level:** 1 (Permission-Based)

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)

```
1. Quick idea for {{company}}
2. {{first_name}} - one workflow to automate
3. Save 5 hours/week at {{company}}
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Most {{industry}} teams I talk to have one workflow that eats up way too much time—usually something like data entry, reporting, or lead research.

We help companies like {{company}} automate that one thing first. No 6-month project. Just pick the biggest time-waster and fix it.

**Example:** A 25-person {{industry}} company automated their weekly reporting and got 8 hours back per person, per month.

Worth a quick look?

Reply "yes" and I'll send a 2-minute breakdown of how we do it.

Best,

## ANGLE B: Time Savings (The "Get Your Weekends Back" Play)

**When to Use:** Ops-heavy roles (Operations, Admin, Project Managers)  
**CTA Ladder Level:** 2 (Value Asset)

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)

```
1. {{first_name}} - 10 hours back per week
2. What if {{company}}'s admin work did itself?
3. AI for the boring stuff at {{company}}
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{first_name}},

The teams I work with typically waste 10-15 hours per week on tasks that should be automated: data entry, status updates, scheduling, and reporting.

We use AI agents to handle that—not a "chatbot" but actual workflow automation that runs 24/7.

**Quick wins we see for {{industry}} teams:**
- Auto-updating spreadsheets and dashboards
- Lead research done overnight (you wake up to qualified lists)
- Follow-up emails sent at the right time, automatically

No huge IT project. Start with one workflow, prove it works, expand from there.

Should I send over a quick video showing how this works for teams your size?

## ANGLE C: Competitor FOMO (The "Others Are Already Doing This" Play)

**When to Use:** Competitive industries (agencies, SaaS, consulting)  
**CTA Ladder Level:** 1 (Permission-Based / Curiosity)

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)

```
1. What {{industry}} teams are automating
2. {{first_name}} - how competitors are scaling
3. AI adoption in {{industry}}
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've been working with a few {{industry}} companies lately, and there's a pattern:

The ones pulling ahead are automating the "invisible work"—the research, the data entry, the follow-ups that eat up 40-60% of everyone's week.

**What they're automating:**
- Lead research and scoring (AI does it overnight)
- Proposal drafts and first-pass content
- Client onboarding workflows
- Reporting and status updates

Not asking you to rip out your tech stack. Just add a layer of AI that handles the repetitive stuff.

Curious if {{company}} has looked into this yet?

Just reply "show me"—I'll send a quick breakdown of what we're seeing work.

Best,

## ANGLE D: DIY Resource (The "Ungated Value" Play)

**When to Use:** Very small companies (<30), budget-conscious, early-stage  
**CTA Ladder Level:** 1 (Permission-Based, Softest)

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)

1. Free AI checklist for {{industry}}

3. AI quick wins (no sales pitch)
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I put together a 1-page checklist of the 5 "quick win" AI automations that work best for {{industry}} teams under 50 people.

No fluff, no 30-minute demo required—just actionable stuff you can implement yourself or hand to your ops person.

**Includes:**
- Top 5 workflows to automate first (and why)
- Tools that work for small budgets (<$100/month)
- Common mistakes to avoid

Mind if I send it over?

(No strings attached—it's genuinely useful even if we never talk.)
