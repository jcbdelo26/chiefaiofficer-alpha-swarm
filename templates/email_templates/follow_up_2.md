## VARIANT A: The "Permission to Close" Break-Up

**Best For:** When you've sent 2+ emails with no response—closes the loop gracefully

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `Closing the loop / {{company}}`
2. `{{first_name}} - closing your file`
3. `Last note`
4. `Moving on`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming AI implementation isn't a top-three priority for {{company}} this quarter.

I'll take this off my follow-up list.

If things change down the road—whether it's a new budget cycle, a strategic shift, or just curiosity—you know where to find me.

Wishing you and the {{company}} team continued success.

Best,

## VARIANT B: The "Last Value Drop" Break-Up

**Best For:** When you want to leave a final piece of value

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `Last note from me`
2. `{{first_name}} - one last thing`
3. `Breaking up is hard to do`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Last note from me—I don't want to clutter your inbox.

I reached out because {{company}} fits the profile of companies successfully using AI for operational efficiency ({{industry}}, 51-500 employees, growth stage).

**If now's not the time**, no problem at all. I'll close this loop.

**If you're curious**, here's what a 15-minute call would cover:
- The 3 "quick win" automations we're seeing work in {{industry}}
- Real metrics from similar companies (hours saved, productivity boost)
- What implementation looks like (90 days, not 9 months)

Either way, best of luck with {{company}}'s growth.

Cheers,
**Dani Apgar**  
Chief AI Officer  
[Book call](https://caio.cx/ai-exec-briefing-call) (or just reply "not now")

## VARIANT C: The "Timing Check" Break-Up

**Best For:** When you want to set a future follow-up

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `Re: {{company}} - timing?`
2. `{{first_name}} - check back later?`
3. `Bad timing?`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Completely understand if now's not the right time—timing is everything.

Would it make sense for me to reach back out in Q{{next_quarter}}? 

Happy to set a reminder and reconnect when AI implementation moves higher on {{company}}'s priority list.

Just let me know what works, and I'll follow up then.

Best,
**Dani Apgar**

## VARIANT D: The "Honest Direct" Break-Up

**Best For:** Executives who appreciate directness

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `{{first_name}} - yes, no, or not yet?`
2. `One-word reply?`
3. `Quick check`

**Email Body:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple of times about AI automation for {{company}}.

Not trying to be a pest—just want to know where you stand:

- **Yes**: Let's talk—reply and I'll send a calendar link
- **No**: Not a fit—I'll remove you from my list
- **Not yet**: Bad timing—tell me when to check back

One word is all I need.

Best,
**Dani Apgar**  
Chief AI Officer

## Break-Up Email Best Practices

### What Works:
- ✅ Give them an "out" (reduces pressure, sometimes triggers response)
- ✅ Keep it short (under 100 words)
- ✅ Maintain professionalism (no guilt trips)
- ✅ Leave door open for future ("you know where to find me")
- ✅ Reference their company context (shows you're not mass-blasting)

### What to Avoid:
- ❌ Passive-aggressive tone ("I guess you're not interested...")
- ❌ Too many CTAs (one or zero is best)
- ❌ Desperation ("I'd really love to connect...")
- ❌ Long explanations of your value prop (they've heard it)

## Post-Break-Up Actions

| Response Type | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **No reply** | Move to 6-month nurture sequence |
| **"Not interested"** | Add to suppression list, send graceful close |
| **"Bad timing"** | Set reminder for Q+1, move to warm nurture |
| **"Yes/Tell me more"** | HOT LEAD - immediate escalation to Dani |
