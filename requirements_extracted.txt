ANGLE A: Executive Buy-In (The "Fractional CAIO" Gap)
Subject Line Options:

AI Roadmap for {{company}}
Quick question regarding {{company}}'s AI strategy
Fractional AI leadership for {{company}}

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

Seeing a lot of {{industry}} firms stuck in "AI research mode" without moving to implementation.

Usually, it's because the CTO is buried in legacy tech and there's no dedicated AI lead to drive the strategy forward.

We act as your Fractional Chief AI Officer to move {{company}} from curiosity to ROI—typically in 90 days.

**What that looks like:**
- Day 1: One-day M.A.P. Bootcamp (your team leaves with an AI-ready action plan)
- Days 2-90: We embed with your team, build the workflows, and measure results
- Guarantee: Measurable ROI, or you don't pay the next phase

Worth a brief chat on how we're doing this for similar {{industry}} companies?

Best,

Hi {{first_name}},
Seeing a lot of {{industry}} firms stuck in "AI research mode."
No roadmap. No AI lead. CTO buried in legacy systems.
That’s where we come in.
We embed as your Fractional Chief AI Officer—taking {{company}} from curiosity to compounding ROI in just 90 days.
Here’s how the M.A.P.™ Framework works:

Days 2–90: We embed, build high-impact pilots, track KPIs
Guarantee: Measurable ROI—or you don’t pay the next phase
We’ve done this for construction, biotech, PE-backed firms, and more. One client clawed back 1,000+ hours annually in a single pilot.
Worth a quick chat this week to explore how this could work at {{company}}?

Hi {{first_name}},

Many {{industry}} CEOs I speak with are frustrated by thin margins and operational inefficiency.

The fix we're seeing work: AI automating the back-office "drudge work"—project estimation, invoicing, scheduling, reporting—so your team can focus on revenue.

**Example:** A 150-person {{industry}} firm saved 300+ hours in 30 days and saw a 27% productivity boost after our 90-day AI pilot.

Are you open to seeing a quick breakdown of the workflow we built for them?

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} is using {{tech_stack}}—we actually have a specific AI integration playbook for that stack.

Most {{title}} roles I talk to are seeing two blockers:
1. The CTO is buried in legacy tech maintenance
2. No dedicated AI strategy lead to drive implementation

We bridge that gap as your Fractional Chief AI Officer—moving from "AI pilot" to production workflows in 90 days.

**What teams like yours are automating:**
- Lead enrichment & qualification (from raw data to booked meetings)
- Document processing & extraction (invoices, contracts, reports)
- Customer support triage (route, respond, escalate)

Would it be helpful if I shared the AI tech stack we're seeing work best for {{industry}}?

AI for operations teams at {{company}}

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

The teams we work with are seeing 40-60% time savings on operational tasks using AI automation.

**Specifically:**
- One 150-person firm saved 300+ hours in 30 days on administrative work
- A 7-person pilot team saw 27% productivity boost in the first month
- AI now handles the work of 20+ staff in Operations at one of our travel clients

The pattern: start with high-volume, low-complexity tasks (data entry, scheduling, reporting), prove ROI in 30 days, then expand.

We call it the M.A.P. framework: **Measure → Automate → Prove**

Open to a brief sync next Tuesday, or should I just send over a one-pager for now?

ANGLE C: Innovation/Transformation Champion Play
Subject Line Options:

AI transformation at {{company}}
{{first_name}} - building the AI Council
Accelerating {{company}}'s AI roadmap

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

75%+ of AI pilots stall before ROI is proven.

The root cause we see: insufficient governance and process integration. CFOs see spend but not savings. Teams focus on "AI chatbots" instead of operational transformation.

We fix this by building an **AI Council** inside your company—internal champions from every department who drive adoption from within.

**Our 90-day approach:**
1. Day 1: Executive bootcamp (your team leaves AI-ready)
2. Weeks 2-8: We co-pilot with your AI Council, build the workflows
3. Weeks 9-12: Measure ROI, hand off the playbook

If the M.A.P. cycle doesn't deliver tangible savings, you don't pay the next phase.

Mind if I send over a 2-minute video on how we do this?

{{first_name}} - one workflow to automate
Save 5 hours/week at {{company}}

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

Most {{industry}} teams I talk to have one workflow that eats up way too much time—usually something like data entry, reporting, or lead research.

We help companies like {{company}} automate that one thing first. No 6-month project. Just pick the biggest time-waster and fix it.

**Example:** A 25-person {{industry}} company automated their weekly reporting and got 8 hours back per person, per month.

Worth a quick look?

AI for the boring stuff at {{company}}

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

The teams I work with typically waste 10-15 hours per week on tasks that should be automated: data entry, status updates, scheduling, and reporting.

We use AI agents to handle that—not a "chatbot" but actual workflow automation that runs 24/7.

**Quick wins we see for {{industry}} teams:**
- Auto-updating spreadsheets and dashboards
- Lead research done overnight (you wake up to qualified lists)
- Follow-up emails sent at the right time, automatically

No huge IT project. Start with one workflow, prove it works, expand from there.

Should I send over a quick video showing how this works for teams your size?

Email Body:

Hi {{first_name}},

I've been working with a few {{industry}} companies lately, and there's a pattern:

The ones pulling ahead are automating the "invisible work"—the research, the data entry, the follow-ups that eat up 40-60% of everyone's week.

**What they're automating:**
- Lead research and scoring (AI does it overnight)
- Proposal drafts and first-pass content
- Client onboarding workflows
- Reporting and status updates

Not asking you to rip out your tech stack. Just add a layer of AI that handles the repetitive stuff.

Curious if {{company}} has looked into this yet?

2.3 Pain Point Signals (High Intent)


📝 SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING PLAYBOOK

3.1 Top 5 Objections & Approved Responses
Objection 1: "We already have a CRM / Apollo / ZoomInfo"
Response:

"Great tools for data. We actually sit on top of them. While they provide the 'who,' we automate the 'what' and 'how'—doing the research and writing the personalized copy so your reps don't have to."

Key Points:

Position as complementary, not competitive
Focus on the "last mile" automation they're missing
Offer to show the integration


Objection 2: "Already have a solution" / "We do this in-house"
Response:

"That makes sense—glad you have something in place. Out of curiosity, how's it working for you? I ask because we've had a few companies your size recently switch over, and they mentioned gaps around forecasting accuracy, pipeline visibility, or rep productivity. Not trying to poach you, but if you ever want to compare notes, happy to share what we're seeing."

Key Points:

Acknowledge their current solution
Plant seeds of doubt with specific pain points
Offer value without pushing


Objection 3: "What's the pricing?"
Response:

"Great question—I want to give you the right context. Our pricing is typically based on team size, which capabilities you need, and implementation scope. Most teams like yours see ROI within the first 90 days through rep productivity improvements, pipeline accuracy, and hours saved per rep per week. Rather than throw numbers at you, it might make more sense to hop on a quick call so I can understand your specific situation and give you a tailored estimate. Would that be helpful?"

Key Points:

Don't quote price before understanding their needs
Lead with ROI and value
Pivot to a conversation


Objection 4: "Not interested" / "Not a priority right now"
Response:

"Totally understand—I appreciate you letting me know. I'll remove you from our outreach. If things change down the road or you'd ever like to explore how we're helping revenue teams like yours, feel free to reach out. Wishing you and the team continued success."

Key Points:

Graceful exit
Leave door open
Remove from sequence immediately


Objection 5: "Need to talk to my team" / "Let me get back to you"
Response:

"Completely understand—timing is everything. Would it make sense for me to reach back out next quarter? Happy to set a reminder and reconnect when it's more relevant for your team. Just let me know what works, and I'll follow up then."

Key Points:

Schedule specific follow-up
Don't let them disappear into the void
Offer to send resources they can share


3.2 Additional Response Templates
"Bad timing / Budget frozen"
"Understood. Is this a 'not now' or a 'never'? If it's timing, I'll send a 2-min video you can watch when things quiet down. We've also helped teams show internal ROI to unlock budget—happy to share how if that's helpful."
"Implementation takes too long"
"Totally fair concern. Most of our clients are live within 2-3 weeks, not months. We've built a 'QuickStart' process specifically for teams that need speed. Happy to walk you through what that looks like."
"Send me some info"
"Absolutely. What specifically would be most helpful—case studies from companies your size, a product overview, or pricing framework? I want to send exactly what you need."
