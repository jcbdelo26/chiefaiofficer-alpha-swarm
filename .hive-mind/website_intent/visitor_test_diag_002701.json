    "body": "Hi Test,\n\nI saw you were reading our piece on how P&G cut product development time by 22% using AI.\n\nMy colleague Dani Apgar spent time at Gong and often mentions how critical it was to have real-time visibility into what was actually moving deals forward vs. creating friction.\n\nAs a VP of Sales, I'm curious - what's the biggest source of drag between your sales and product teams when it comes to getting customer feedback into the development cycle?\n\nI've been showing sales leaders a simple 10-minute AI framework that helps them:\n\u2022 Get product updates to reps 3x faster\n\u2022 Surface which features actually drive deals\n\u2022 Cut the back-and-forth between teams by 40%+\n\nAll without adding headcount or new processes.\n\nWorth a quick conversation later today or tomorrow?\n\n--\nDani Apgar\nHead of Partnerships & Revenue, Chief AI Officer Inc.\ndani@chiefaiofficer.com | chiefaiofficer.com\nBook a 15-min intro: https://caio.cx/meet",
