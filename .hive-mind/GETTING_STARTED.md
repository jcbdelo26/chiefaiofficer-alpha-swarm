## 📊 Your Current Status

Based on the diagnostic I ran:

```
✅ WORKING (4/8):
  ✅ Supabase - Database operational
  ✅ GoHighLevel - Connected to "CAIO Corporate"
  ✅ Clay - API key valid
  ✅ Dependencies - All installed

❌ NEEDS FIXING (3/8):
  ❌ Instantly - Invalid API key (15 min fix)
  ❌ LinkedIn - Session expired (10 min fix)
  ❌ Anthropic - Need API key (5 min fix)

⚠️  OPTIONAL (1/8):
  ⚠️  RB2B - Placeholder key (setup later)
```

**You're 50% there!** Just need to fix 3 API keys and you're fully operational.
