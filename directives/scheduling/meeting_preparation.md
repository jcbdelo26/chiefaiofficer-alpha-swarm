## Failure Handling

If research fails:

1. **Partial data**: Deliver what we have + flag gaps
2. **No data**: Alert AE, suggest postponing if critical
3. **API errors**: Use cached data, note staleness
4. **Time crunch**: Prioritize Quick Glance + Questions

---

## Feedback Loop

After each meeting, capture:

1. **Did the brief help?** (1-5 rating)
2. **What was missing?**
3. **What was inaccurate?**
4. **What was most useful?**

Feed into self-annealing to improve future briefs.
