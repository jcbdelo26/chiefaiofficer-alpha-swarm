```
Research Points:

## 📊 CTA LADDER (Soft → Hard)

### Level 1: Permission-Based (Softest)
```
"Mind if I send the link over?"
"Want me to share a 2-min video?"
"Just reply 'yes' and I'll send it."
```

### Level 2: Value Asset
```
"Should I send over a one-pager for now?"
"Would it be helpful if I shared the tech stack breakdown?"
"I put together a quick resource—want a copy?"
```

### Level 3: Low-Commitment Meeting
```
"Open to a brief sync next Tuesday?"
"Worth a 10-minute chat?"
"15 minutes to see if there's a fit?"
```

### Level 4: Direct Booking (Hardest)
```
"Book a 15-min briefing: [link]"
"Here's my calendar: [link]"
"Ready to talk? [Book Demo]"
```

**Strategy:** Start at Level 1-2 for cold outreach. Escalate to Level 3-4 in follow-ups or for warm leads.
